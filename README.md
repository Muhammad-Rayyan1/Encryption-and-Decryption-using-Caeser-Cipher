# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

## Description
This project demonstrates encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher technique, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a specified number of places. It provides a simple implementation for encrypting and decrypting messages through a web interface.

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value.
- Supports a customizable alphabet and shift key.
- Options to maintain, lower, or upper case letters.
- Handles non-alphabet characters by removing or ignoring them.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and layout of the web interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the web interface.
- `caesar.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory:
    ```bash
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Use the form to enter your plaintext or ciphertext.
3. Select whether you want to encode (encrypt) or decode (decrypt).
4. Adjust the shift key, modulo, and other settings as needed.
5. Click the "Submit" button to see the encrypted or decrypted result.

### Example
To encrypt the message "Hello, World!" with a shift of 3:
1. Enter "Hello, World!" in the plaintext area.
2. Ensure "Encode" is selected.
3. Set the shift key to 3.
4. Click "Submit" to see the ciphertext.
